They are known for their playful and curious nature. 
These animals are also incredibly intelligent and can be very social. 
Because of their intelligence and social nature, dolphins are often used in research studies.
Elephants are some of the largest animals on Earth. 
They can weigh up to two thousand pounds and can reach a height of six feet tall. 
Elephants are primarily herbivores, meaning that they eat plants. 
However, they can also consume small amounts of meat if they need to. 
Elephants are considered to be one of the most intelligent creatures 
on Earth, and they use their brains to solve complex problems.    
The walrus is a unique animal that has been around for centuries. 
While its exact origins are unknown, it is believed to have evolved 
from a combination of several other species. For the most part, the 
walrus is a solitary creature that lives in coastal areas and feeds on 
clams, crabs, and other aquatic creatures. The walrus is also known for 
its huge tusks, which can grow up to two meters long.
Crab is a popular seafood dish that can be enjoyed in many different ways.

steamed, or grilled. Some people also enjoy crab claws as a snack. 
Crab is an affordable and versatile seafood option that can be enjoyed 
at any time of year.
Her hand was balled into a fist with her keys protruding out from between
her fingers. This was the weapon her father had shown her how to make when 
she walked alone to her car after work. She wished that she had something a 
little more potent than keys between her fingers. It would have been nice to 
have some mace or pepper spray. He had been meaning to buy some but had never 
gotten around to it. As the mother bear took another step forward with her cubs 
in tow, she knew her fist with keys wasn't going to be an adequate defense for this situation.
The clowns had taken over. And yes, they were literally clowns. Over 100 had 
appeared out of a small VW bug that had been driven up to the bank. Now they 
were all inside and had taken it over.
There once lived an old man and an old woman who were peasants and had to work 
hard to earn their daily bread. The old man used to go to fix fences and do other 
odd jobs for the farmers around, and while he was gone the old woman, his wife, 
did the work of the house and worked in their own little plot of land.
He wondered if he should disclose the truth to his friends. It would be a risky 
move. Yes, the truth would make things a lot easier if they all stayed on the same 
age, but the truth might fracture the group leaving everything in even more of a 
mess than it was not telling the truth. It was time to decide which way to go.
He lifted the bottle to his lips and took a sip of the drink. He had tasted this 
before, but he couldn't quite remember the time and place it had happened. 
He desperately searched his mind trying to locate and remember where he had tasted 
this when the bicycle ran over his foot.
It was that terrifying feeling you have as you tightly hold the covers over you 
with the knowledge that there is something hiding under your bed. You want to look, 
but you don't at the same time. You're frozen with fear and unable to act. That's 
where she found herself and she didn't know what to do next
Many people say that life isn't like a bed of roses. I beg to differ. I think that 
life is quite like a bed of roses. Just like life, a bed of roses looks pretty on 
the outside, but when you're in it, you find that it is nothing but thorns and pain. I myself have been pricked quite badly.
Why do Americans have so many different types of towels? We have beach towels, hand 
towels, bath towels, dish towels, camping towels, quick-dry towels, and let’s not 
forget paper towels. Would 1 type of towel work for each of these things? 
Let’s take a beach towel. It can be used to dry your hands and body with no 
difficulty. A beach towel could be used to dry dishes. Just think how many dishes 
you could dry with one beach towel. I’ve used a beach towel with no adverse effects 
while camping. If you buy a thin beach towel it can dry quickly too. I’d probably 
cut up a beach towel to wipe down counters or for cleaning other items, but a full 
beach towel could be used too. Is having so many types of towels an extravagant 
luxury that Americans enjoy or is it necessary? I’d say it's overkill and we could 
cut down on the many types of towels that manufacturers deem necessary.
To the two friends, the treehouse was much more than a treehouse. 
It was a sanctuary away from the other kids where they could be themselves 
without being teased or bullied. It was their secret fortress hidden high in the 
branches of a huge oak that only they knew existed. At least that is what they 
thought. They were more than a little annoyed when their two younger sisters 
decided to turn the treehouse into a princess castle by painting the inside pink 
and putting glitter everywhere.
It all started with the computer. Had he known what was to follow, he would have 
never logged on that day. But the truth was there was no way to know what was about 
to happen. So Dave pressed the start button, the computer booted up, the screen came alive, and everything Dave knew to be true no longer was.
It probably seemed trivial to most people, but it mattered to Tracey. She wasn't 
sure why it mattered so much to her, but she understood deep within her being that 
it mattered to her. So for the 365th day in a row, Tracey sat down to eat pancakes for breakfast.
It was the best compliment that he'd ever received although the person who gave it 
likely never knew. It had been an off-hand observation on his ability to hold a 
conversation and actually add pertinent information to it on practically any topic.
 Although he hadn't consciously strived to be able to do so, he'd started to voraciously read the news when he couldn't keep up on topics his friends discussed because their conversations went above his head. The fact that someone had noticed enough to compliment him that he could talk intelligently about many topics meant that he had succeeded in his quest to be better informed.
Puppies are soft, cute, funny, and make a big mess. Every month or two our family 
fosters 6-12 week old puppies for a puppy rescue nonprofit organization. We all 
enjoy cuddling their furry bodies after a clean bath. Fresh puppy smell is great. 
The puppies play with each other and our adult dog. They look so funny when they lay on top of each other and sleep. While puppies can be great fun, they also can make big messes. 4-6 puppies can make a lot of puppy pee and poop. It's a challenge to keep the puppies and the puppy pen clean.
It really doesn't matter what she thinks as it isn't her problem to solve. 
That's what he kept trying to convince himself. She was trying to insert 
her opinion where it wasn't wanted or welcome. He already had a plan and 
even though that plan didn't correspond with what she wanted him to do or what 
should be done, it wasn't her decision to make. The question now became whether 
he would stick to his convictions and go through with his plan knowing she wouldn't approve.
There was something in the sky. What exactly was up there wasn't immediately clear. 
But there was definitely something in the sky and it was getting bigger and bigger.
The towels had been hanging from the rod for years. They were stained and worn, and 
quite frankly, just plain ugly. Debra didn't want to touch them but she really 
didn't have a choice. It was important for her to see what was living within them.
They had always called it the green river. It made sense. The river was green. 
The river likely had a different official name, but to everyone in town, it was 
and had always been the green river. So it was with great surprise that on this 
day the green river was a fluorescent pink.
It was a simple green chair. There was nothing extraordinary about it or so it 
seemed. It was the type of chair one would pass without even noticing it was there, 
let alone what the actual color of it was. It was due to this common and unassuming 
appearance that few people actually stopped to sit in it and discover its magical powers.
She sat down with her notebook in her hand, her mind wandering to faraway places. 
She paused and considered all that had happened. It hadn't gone as expected. 
When the day began she thought it was going to be a bad one, but as she sat 
recalling the day's events to write them down, she had to admit, 
it had been a rather marvelous day.
Stranded. Yes, she was now the first person ever to land on Venus, 
but that was of little consequence. Her name would be read by millions 
in school as the first to land here, but that celebrity would never 
actually be seen by her. She looked at the control panel and knew there was 
nothing that would ever get it back into working order. She was the first 
and it was not clear this would also be her last.
It was a weird concept. Why would I really need to generate a 
random paragraph? Could I actually learn something from doing so? 
All these questions were running through her head as she pressed the generate button. 
To her surprise, she found what she least expected to see.
He hid under the covers hoping that nobody would notice him there. 
It really didn't make much sense since it would be obvious to anyone who 
walked into the room there was someone hiding there, but he still held out 
hope. He heard footsteps coming down the hall and stop in front in front of 
the bedroom door. He heard the squeak of the door hinges and someone opened 
the bedroom door. He held his breath waiting for whoever was about to discover 
him, but they never did.
Mary had to make a decision and she knew that whatever decision she made, 
it would upset someone. It seemed like such a silly reason for people to get 
upset but she knew the minute that she began to consider doing it that there 
was no way everyone in her life would be pleased with what she ultimately 
decided to do. It was simply a question of who she would rather displease most. 
While this had always been her parents, and especially her mom, in the past 
that she tried to keep from upsetting, she decided that this time the person 
she was going to please the most with her decision was herself.
The time to take action was now. All three men knew in their hearts this was 
the case, yet none of them moved a muscle to try. They were all watching and 
waiting for one of the others to make the first move so they could follow a step 
or two behind and help. The situation demanded a leader and all three men were followers.
The day had begun on a bright note. The sun finally peeked through the rain for 
the first time in a week, and the birds were singing in its warmth. 
There was no way to anticipate what was about to happen. It was a worst-case 
scenario and there was no way out of it.
The headache wouldn't go away. She's taken medicine but even that didn't help. 
The monstrous throbbing in her head continued. She had this happen to her only 
once before in her life and she realized that only one thing could be happening.
It went through such rapid contortions that the little bear was forced to change 
his hold on it so many times he became confused in the darkness, and could not, 
for the life of him, tell whether he held the sheep right side up, or upside down. 
But that point was decided for him a moment later by the animal itself, who, with 
a sudden twist, jabbed its horns so hard into his lowest ribs that he gave a grunt 
of anger and disgust.
Peter always saw the world in black and white. There were two choices for every 
situation and you had to choose one of them. It was therefore terribly 
uncomfortable for him to spend time with Ashley. She saw the world in shades 
of gray with hundreds of choices to choose from in every situation.
She glanced up into the sky to watch the clouds taking shape. First, she saw a dog. 
Next, it was an elephant. Finally, she saw a giant umbrella and at that moment 
the rain began to pour.
It really didn't matter what they did to him. He's already made up his mind. 
Whatever came his way, he was prepared for the consequences. He knew in his heart 
that the sacrifice he made was done with love and not hate no matter how others 
decided to spin it.
Twenty seconds were all that was left and Richard could hear each one tick by. 
Fifteen seconds now remained and the panic began to fully set in. Ten seconds 
and he wasn't sure he had enough time. Five seconds, four, three, two, one...
Debbie knew she was being selfish and unreasonable. She understood why the others 
in the room were angry and frustrated with her and the way she was acting. 
In her eyes, it didn't really matter how they felt because she simply didn't care.
Another option you have is choosing the number of syllables in the words you speak. 
You probably have never considered this option before, but you have it every 
time you open your mouth and speak. You make so many choices like this that you 
never even think about, but you have the choice with each one. What are you going 
to do with this knowledge?
It was a concerning development that he couldn't get out of his mind. 
He'd had many friends throughout his early years and had fond memories of 
playing with them, but he couldn't understand how it had all stopped. 
There was some point as he grew up that he played with each of his friends 
for the very last time, and he had no idea that it would be the last.
She didn't like the food. She never did. She made the usual complaints and 
started the tantrum he knew was coming. But this time was different. Instead 
of trying to placate her and her unreasonable demands, he just stared at her 
and watched her meltdown without saying a word.
Her breath exited her mouth in big puffs as if she were smoking a cigarette. 
The morning dew had made her clothes damp and she shivered from the chill 
in the air. There was only one thing that could get her up and out this early in the morning.
She closed her eyes and then opened them again. What she was seeing just didn't 
make sense. She shook her head seeing if that would help. It didn't. 
Although it seemed beyond reality, there was no denying she was witnessing a 
large formation of alien spaceships filling the sky.
The wolves stopped in their tracks, sizing up the mother and her cubs. 
It had been over a week since their last meal and they were getting desperate. 
The cubs would make a good meal, but there were high risks taking on the mother 
Grizzly. A decision had to be made and the wrong choice could signal the end of the pack.
"It's never good to give them details," Janice told her sister. 
"Always be a little vague and keep them guessing." Her sister listened intently 
and nodded in agreement. She didn't fully understand what her sister 
was saying but that didn't matter. She loved her so much that she would 
have agreed to whatever came out of her mouth.
The boxed moved. That was a problem. Peter had packed the box three hours before 
and there was nothing inside that should make it move. The question now was whether 
or not Peter was going to open it up and look inside to see why it had moved. 
The answer to that question was obvious. Peter dropped the package into the mailbox 
so he would never have to see it again.
It was a simple green chair. There was nothing extraordinary about it or 
so it seemed. It was the type of chair one would pass without even noticing 
it was there, let alone what the actual color of it was. It was due to this 
common and unassuming appearance that few people actually stopped to sit in it

Stormi is a dog. She is dark grey and has long legs. Her eyes are expressive 
and are able to let her humans know what she is thinking. Her tongue is long,
 pink, and wet. Her long legs allow her to sprint after other dogs, people or 
 bunnies. She can be a good dog, but also very bad. Her tail wags when happy or 
 excited and hides between her back legs when she is bad. Stormi is a dog I love.
It had been a rough day. Things hadn't gone as planned and that meant Hannah got 
yelled at by her boss. It didn't even matter that it wasn't her fault. When things
 went wrong at work, Hannah got the blame no matter the actual circumstances. 
 It wasn't fair, but there was little she could do without risking her job, and 
 she wasn't in a position to do that with the plans she had.
Sometimes it's the first moment of the day that catches you off guard. That's what 
Wendy was thinking. She opened her window to see fire engines screeching down the 
street. While this wasn't something completely unheard of, it also wasn't normal. 
It was a sure sign of what was going to happen that day. She could feel it in her 
bones and it wasn't the way she wanted the day to begin.
I'm going to hire professional help tomorrow. I can't handle this anymore. 
She fell over the coffee table and now there is blood in her catheter. 
This is much more than I ever signed up to do.
The trees, therefore, must be such old and primitive techniques that they 
thought nothing of them, deeming them so inconsequential that even savages 
like us would know of them and not be suspicious. At that, they probably didn't 
have too much time after they detected us orbiting and intending to land. 
And if that were true, there could be only one place where their civilization was hidden.
She tried not to judge him. His ratty clothes and unkempt hair made him 
look homeless. Was he really the next Einstein as she had been told? On the 
off chance it was true, she continued to try not to judge him.
He watched as the young man tried to impress everyone in the room with his 
intelligence. There was no doubt that he was smart. The fact that he was more 
intelligent than anyone else in the room could have been easily deduced, 
but nobody was really paying any attention due to the fact that it was also 
obvious that the young man only cared about his intelligence.
Waiting and watching. It was all she had done for the past weeks. When you’re 
locked in a room with nothing but food and drink, that’s about all you can do 
anyway. She watched as birds flew past the window bolted shut. She couldn’t 
reach it if she wanted too, with that hole in the floor. She thought she could 
escape through it but three stories is a bit far down.
I don’t like cats and they don’t like me. I used to be allergic to them and 
I would get stuffed up and have hives. That doesn’t seem to happen anymore. 
But I still don’t like them. I lived with 3 cats that were not good at peeing 
in the litter box. They seemed to find something important to me and pee on it. 
Most of the time they peed on photographs or papers that would be ruined. 
Cats also bring fleas into the house. There is nothing worse than having to flea 
dip cats and also flea bomb a home. That is why I don’t like cats.
There was a leak in the boat. Nobody had yet noticed it, and nobody would for 
the next couple of hours. This was a problem since the boat was heading out to 
sea and while the leak was quite small at the moment, it would be much larger 
when it was ultimately discovered. John had planned it exactly this way.
Colors bounced around in her head. They mixed and threaded themselves together. 
Even colors that had no business being together. They were all one, yet distinctly 
separate at the same time. How was she going to explain this to the others?
Then came the night of the first falling star. It was seen early in the morning, 
rushing over Winchester eastward, a line of flame high in the atmosphere. 
Hundreds must have seen it and taken it for an ordinary falling star. It seemed 
that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him.
It was that terrifying feeling you have as you tightly hold the covers 
over you with the knowledge that there is something hiding under your bed. 
You want to look, but you don't at the same time. You're frozen with fear 
and unable to act. That's where she found herself and she didn't know what to do next
Out of another, I get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf 
belonging to the estate. There is a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there 
from the house. I always fancy I see people walking in these numerous paths 
and arbors, but John has cautioned me not to give way to fancy in the least. 
He says that with my imaginative power and habit of story-making a nervous 
weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited fancies and that 
I ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency. So I try.
Turning away from the ledge, he started slowly down the mountain, deciding 
that he would, that very night, satisfy his curiosity about the man-house. 
In the meantime, he would go down into the canyon and get a cool drink, after 
which he would visit some berry patches just over the ridge, and explore among 
the foothills a bit before his nap-time, which always came just after the sun 
had walked past the middle of the sky. At that period of the day the sun’s 
warm rays seemed to cast a sleepy spell over the silent mountainside, so all 
of the animals, with one accord, had decided it should be the hour for their mid-day sleep.
I guess we could discuss the implications of the phrase "meant to be." 
That is if we wanted to drown ourselves in a sea of backwardly referential 
semantics and other mumbo-jumbo. Maybe such a discussion would result in the 
determination that "meant to be" is exactly as meaningless a phrase as it 
seems to be, and that none of us is actually meant to be doing anything at all. 
But that's my existential underpants underpinnings showing. 
It's the way the cookie crumbles. And now I want a cookie.
He walked down the steps from the train station in a bit of a hurry knowing 
the secrets in the briefcase must be secured as quickly as possible. Bounding 
down the steps, he heard something behind him and quickly turned in a panic. 
There was nobody there but a pair of old worn-out shoes were placed neatly 
on the steps he had just come down. Had he past them without seeing them? 
It didn't seem possible. He was about to turn and be on his way when a deep 
chill filled his body.
It was a rat's nest. Not a literal one, but that is what her hair seemed to 
resemble every morning when she got up. It was going to take at least an 
hour to get it under control and she was sick and tired of it. She peered 
into the mirror and wondered if it was worth it. It wasn't. She opened the 
drawer and picked up the hair clippers.
"So, what do you think?" he asked nervously. He wanted to know the answer, 
but at the same time, he didn't. He'd put his heart and soul into the project 
and he wasn't sure he'd be able to recover if they didn't like what he produced. 
The silence from the others in the room seemed to last a lifetime even though it 
had only been a moment since he asked the question. "So, what do you think?" he asked again.
Time is all relative based on age and experience. When you are a child an 
hour is a long time to wait but a very short time when that’s all the time 
you are allowed on your iPad. As a teenager time goes faster the more deadlines 
you have and the more you procrastinate. As a young adult, you think you 
have forever to live and don’t appreciate the time you spend with others. 
As a middle-aged adult, time flies by as you watch your children grow up. 
And finally, as you get old and you have fewer responsibilities and fewer 
demands on you, time slows. You appreciate each day and are thankful you are 
alive. An hour is the same amount of time for everyone yet it can feel so 
different in how it goes by.
Things aren't going well at all with mom today. She is just a limp noodle and 
wants to sleep all the time. I sure hope that things get better soon.
They decided to find the end of the rainbow. While they hoped they would find a 
pot of gold, neither of them truly believed that the mythical pot would actually 
be there. Nor did they believe they could actually find the end of the rainbow. 
Still, it seemed like a fun activity for the day, and pictures of them chasing 
rainbows would look great on their Instagram accounts. They would have never 
believed they would actually find the end of a rainbow, and when they did, 
what they actually found there.
Stranded. Yes, she was now the first person ever to land on Venus, but that 
was of little consequence. Her name would be read by millions in school as the

The leather jacked showed the scars of being his favorite for years. It wore 
those scars with pride, feeling that they enhanced his presence rather than 
diminishing it. The scars gave it character and had not overwhelmed to the point 
that it had become ratty. The jacket was in its prime and it knew it.
Brenda never wanted to be famous. While most of her friends dreamed about being 
famous, she could see the negative aspects that those who wanted to be famous 
seemed to ignore. The fact that you could never do anything in public without 
being mobbed and the complete lack of privacy was something that she never wanted 
to experience. She also had no desire to have strangers speculating about every 
aspect of her life and what each thing she did was supposed to mean. Brenda was 
perfectly happy with her anonymous life where she could do exactly as she wanted 
without anyone else giving a damn. Thus, her overnight Internet celebrity was 
not something she was thrilled about as her friends told her how lucky she was.
She has seen this scene before. It had come to her in dreams many times before. 
She had to pinch herself to make sure it wasn't a dream again. As her fingers 
squeezed against her arm, she felt the pain. It was this pain that immediately woke her up.
Her hair was a tangled mess which she tried to make presentable by putting in 
a lump on the top of her head. It didn't really work although it was a valiant 
attempt. While most people simply noticed the tangled mess on top of her head, 
what most people failed to understand that within the tangles mess was an 
entirely new year. That was her secret. She kept worlds on top of her head.
